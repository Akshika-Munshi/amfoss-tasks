#BANDIT 
this was the most fun task and probably the one that i enjoyed doing the most . I had to google about the commands and as problems came up , i used stackoverflow to solve the problems and eventually solved from 0 to 10. Although i was stuck for a little while on the grep command but google to the rescue , always .
