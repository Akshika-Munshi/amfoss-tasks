#DRUM KIT
I had some prior knowledge of HTML from Grade 8 , when HTML was taughgt in school , so this task felt a little familiar.
I copied the link to the font address from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik+Gemstones and modified the java file and the css file then linked it to the head in index.html file , after that i saved the file and since i had not downloaded the required app , i went live , it didnt really work , but after correcting the linking in the script again , i was able to make the html page work.
