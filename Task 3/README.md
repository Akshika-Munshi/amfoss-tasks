### HACKERRANK
This was the task that i thought would be the easiest among all of the tasks but was not at all easy to crack . I have spent endless amount of time on Stackoverflow and GeeksforGeeks , trying to figure out different parts of the same question , since i do not have prior competitive coding experience. <U>Blondiebytes</U> on youtube , proved to be extremly helpful and i also enrolled myself in a python learning program towards the end of November , although i wasnt able to solve many of the challanges on the website , i sure have an increased interest and some basic knowledge about python coding after trying to get this task done . This was a great learning experience and made me realize how coding can be practically put into use .
