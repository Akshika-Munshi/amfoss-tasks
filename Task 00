### HACKTOBER_EVENT
Like everyone i reached at the hacktober event where they were explaining us about how to install ubuntu , but having a  mac , i was just looking at their faces confused and just then a mentorr to my delight told me i dont need ubuntu in order to use git . Although , installing certain commands to be used for the tasks , was a tedious task for me , due to old version of mac and because of the facct that this mac had multiple users , but now i have successfullly done that with the help of mentors and google.
