#Installing Ubuntu
## AKA Level 1 of loosing my mind 
I say this because i am not a very tech savvy person , and i have a mac laptop with me , so whatever instructions we were getting in the hacktobe event were kind of hard to follow and i was like a deer in front of headlights , but to my delight , one of the mentors told me that my device already has Terminal pre installed and that i just needed to locate that and start working on it . Although my initial interraction to git hub was not very smooth , since downloading certain commands on my device was a herculean tasks because there are 2 administrators of my device , and figuring out how to give permissions in the command line interface that i had never used before was a quirky thing to figure out. But now , here i am , with my Mac , working in the terminal .
